# Workout-Demand-Market-Analysis

## Description
Hello and welcome to my first project.

As I will mention in the first section of the Jupyter Notebook as well, here I am taking the hypothetical role of a product manager for a fitness studio based in Romania. To offer a good product that is in line with Romania's demands in the fitness world I've decided to conduct a market analysis in Python.

I will be using multiple datasets in CSV format in the "data" folder, covering international and local data on Google Trends keywords searches related to fitness and related products.

I will use three popular Python libraries for this project: 'pandas', 'seaborn' and 'matplotlib' to explore and visualize this data and drive insights.

## Project Structure
In this GitHub repository you can find three main parts: _the data folder_, the _Jupyter Notebook_ file and the _README_ file that you are reading right now, plus a gym photo I used in the beginning of the Jupyter
Notebook. 
In the data folder you can find all the CSV files that I've downloaded from Google Trends platform. The Jupyter Notebook or the ".ipynb" file is the file with the actual project itself.

## Setup and Installation
You don't really need a setup to check out the project. All you need to do is go to the repository on GitHub and click on the "notebook.ipynb" file to preview it. There you will be able to see the code cells and
their last output, and the text cells where I explain what I did below and what conclusion I got from every output.

If you want to run the project to check if the code is good and runs as shown on GitHub you can download the whole repository as a zip file. You can do that by going to the repository's home page on GitHub,
click on the green "Code" button and "Download as ZIP". From there you can extract it and open it with a hosted python notebook platform like Google Colab, or you can run it locally by using Jupyter Notebook.

## Usage
The code itself doesn't say much about the project for a non-technical person. But the beauty of Jupyter Notebook for Data Analysis projects is that you don't need to understand code necessarily to understand the
takeaways and conclusions. You can read the text cells and view the plots, graphs and other information I displayed in the output to understand what I wanted to point out. 

I tried to be as explicit as possible, 
and I apologise in advance if my explanations are not good enough. I am open for feedback!

## Data
The data I used in this project I got from Google Trends platform. There I looked at the history of difference keyword searches and changed the filters for Romania/Worldwide and the time period I wanted.
Then I downloaded them as CSV files. Google Trends automatically tracks keyword searches weekly for older data.

**NOTE:** Google Trends will adjust to your Google account preferences. For example, I am Romanian, and most of my Google platform are in romanian language. Therefore when I downloaded a CSV file instead of a column
being named "Week" it was named "Săptămână" (the romanian word for week). You may encounter the same problem and need to change it in a text editor.

## Notebook
The Jupyter notebook is structured in an ordered tasks fashion. I tried to make the analysis' order as logical as possible by going from general assessment of popularity to specific workout types. 
Each task/analysis has three parts: _text cell_ in which I explain what I'm doing in the code cell and the conclusion or following steps, _code cell_ where the actual code is and _output_ which is the place
where you'll see what the code actually does like the takeaway, the plot and more.

**NOTE:** If you decide to run the project either locally or on a hosted platform you'll need to run the code cells in order. Skipping over a code cell might result in an error.

## Contributing
I am not exactly looking for any contribution. I think the project met my vision. But that being said, I would like some advice on what I could have done better or more efficiently, so please leave a comment
if that's the case.

## Contact Information
Thank you for checking out my project! Please contact me at nistor.matei21@gmail.com for anything related about this project like suggestions or others.

## Aknowledgements
This initially was a Guided Project that I've done on the platform **Datacamp**, where I was learning Data Analysis with Python. It was originally a project about a Singapore based fitness studio. The original 
project provided six CSV files, from which I kept four, and the Jupyter Notebook came with the two helper functions (that I later adjusted).After finishing the project I decided to continue it and change it
up to be about Romania's demands in the fitness world.
